                    Greetings! I'm Gia Hao, also recognized as Eric, a
                    first-year student enrolled in the BIT program at Red River
                    College in Winnipeg, Manitoba. My expertise lies in the
                    dynamic fields of web and software development, where I
                    excel in creating visually appealing websites and pioneering
                    applications. As a student in the BIT program, I introduce a
                    unique and contemporary approach to both realms. Whether
                    you're in need of a sleek website or seeking assistance with
                    cutting-edge software projects, I'm here to help. Let's
                    collaborate to turn your digital ideas into reality!

                    <p>
                         In my world, inspiration springs from diverse sources.
                         I am captivated by the elegance of well-designed
                         websites, the awe-inspiring beauty of nature
                         encountered during my travels, and the artistry of CSS
                         and JS animations. The narratives of exceptionally
                         excellent individuals, especially the stories of
                         talented young minds making their mark, never fail to
                         ignite my passion for innovation.

                         My current journey of learning is a thrilling odyssey.
                         I'm delving into JavaScript frameworks to elevate my
                         web development skills and unraveling the complexities
                         of advanced C#. Connecting databases to my projects is
                         a skill I'm eager to master, and I'm exploring the
                         collaborative world of GitHub and Git. The realm of
                         Unity beckons as I embark on a journey into game
                         development. Beyond technical skills, I aspire to
                         broaden my network, connecting with individuals outside
                         my field.

                         Balancing my academic commitments in the BIT program at
                         Red River College, I invest my free time in
                         self-learning. The focus now is on mastering
                         JavaScript, with the aim of achieving proficiency by
                         the end of 2023 and venturing into new territories in
                         the following year. Weekends see me at the Outlet Mall,
                         engaging in a part-time job that complements my
                         learning journey.

                         Professionally, I'm intrigued by career promotions and
                         the continual evolution of my skills. On a personal
                         level, my self-taught journey is a source of constant
                         joy and excitement. I derive immense satisfaction from
                         tracking the progress I make over time. Networking is a
                         crucial aspect of my life, and I actively seek
                         meaningful connections. Outside the professional
                         sphere, my interests span from automobiles to immersive
                         gaming experiences.

                         self-learning, exploring new concepts and technologies.
                         Cooking is both a creative outlet and a sensory
                         experience I cherish. Tending to my collection of
                         plants brings a sense of calm and responsibility. As
                         the evening descends, I unwind with gaming, finding joy
                         in virtual adventures.
